Team 1 - Vision Board 8 (The Bohemian Bloom)

Vision Board Analysis

Based on the qualitative analysis we developed as a team, it was clear that our 
clients would like to pursue a Boho-themed wedding party. The couple would like to 
establish trendy and bold aesthetics that connect a comfortable, cozy experience with 
nature. There is extensive usage of natural décor elements based on flowers, fruits, and 
leaves. 

The concepts suggest strong clients’ preferences towards monochromatic 
features with effortless yet free-spirited and cute designs.
All of the presented concepts by clients display a strong use of a Fruity Color 
Palette that is vibrant and sweet: peach, coral, salmon, mustard, and orange. Our 
team assumes that the selected color elements are a must-have characteristic of the 
wedding and they are not willing to pivot to other options.

Another important aspect of our clients’ wedding party is the connection with 
nature. Based on observed elements including tents, gardens, and the backyard 
photoshoot, we infer that the couple would like to pursue a wedding party in an outdoor 
venue.

Based on the provided elements, we tried to find vendors for each product category
that encompassed the essential elements of the Bohemian Bloom Wedding Theme:

1- Boho-themed.
2- Nature-inspired (Flowers, Fruits, and Leaves).
3- Cozy and comfortable.
4- Proximity with nature (Outdoor venue that is prepared for possible weather adversities).
5- Fruity, vibrant, and sweet color palette (Peach, Salmon, Coral, Mustard, Orange, and Pink).

We also created 2 new categories: budget and wedding size.
We are assuming that a wedding is:
1- SMALL if it has 50 guests;
2- MEDIUM if it has 100 guests;
3- LARGE if it has 200 guests;
This assumptions are based on our secondary research and insights found on TheKnot Wedding Analysis (https://www.theknot.com/content/average-wedding-guest-list-size).

For BUDGET, we calculated the price ranges of each product + category combination and we are assuming that services with higher prices are more top-tier (e.g.
a more expensive venue is more luxurious than a cheaper venue). ALL services need to meet our minimum requirements per wedding and per department.

### 1. FLOWERS ###
1- We chose flower products that come from Summer/Spring seasons that would encompass vibrant colors based on
clients' preferred color palette.
2- We also chose flower styles that are Romantic, Natural, and Classic based on requirements: Romantic, Glamorous, Modern,
Classic, Warm, Preppy, and Elegant.
