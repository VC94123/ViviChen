# Overview
# Maintaining a competitive edge in the ever-changing financial services industry requires an understanding of client behavior and the ability to predict turnover. 
# Two datasets contain comprehensive records of current bank clients, encompassing personal data (age, gender, location), financial activity (balance, goods utilized, credit score), and churn status during a certain time frame. This dataset is a key resource for figuring out trends and factors that influence customer attrition, allowing for more focused retention initiatives.
# to use logistic regression and statistics to forecast client attrition, allowing proactive engagement tactics to increase customer retention.

# Load Bank churn  & New Customer dataset

#Understand the relationships between predictors and the response variable in logistic regression.
summary(log.model)
# For example:CreditScore: For each unit increase in credit score, the log-odds of churn decreases by 0.0006539, 
# statistically significant (p = 2.94e-10), suggesting that higher credit scores are associated with lower churn probability.

#Check Prediction accuracy

# logical vector, which is equivalent to the percentage of TRUE values.

# True Negatives (TN): 37,285 is the number of customers that the model accurately estimated would not experience attrition.
# False Positives (FP): 1,749, denoting the customers who did not experience churn but were mispredicted by the model to do so.
# False Negatives (FN): 6,457, the quantity of clients who really left but were mispredicted not to leave.
# True Positives (TP): 4,019 indicates the consumers whose churn the model accurately anticipated.

fitted.results <- as.factor(fitted.results)

sensitivity(test$Exited, fitted.results) # 0.8523844

# Sensitivity: The model correctly identified 85.24% of the customers who exited.This is essential for carrying out focused treatments to keep these clients. 
# Specificity: The model correctly identified 69.68% of the customers who did not exit, as evidenced by the lower specificity when compared to sensitivity,
# this can cause needless retention efforts to be focused on clients who weren't actually in danger of leaving.


# 3. Use the model to predict whether a particular customer would churn or not using the "NewCustomerDataset".

# Generate predictions for the new customer data using the logistic regression model. 
new_customer_predictions <- predict(log.model,newdata=df.customer,type='response')

df.customer$PredictedExited <- ifelse(new_customer_predictions > 0.5, 1, 0)
df.customer$PredictedExited # Shows the predicted classifications for all customers in the new data frame
#Calculates the average of the PredictedExited column, which is the proportion of customers predicted to churn. 
churn_rate <- mean(df.customer$PredictedExited) 
# The churn rate calculated in the previous step is multiplied by 100 to convert it from a proportion to a percentage. 
print(paste("predict churn rateï¼š", churn_rate * 100, "%"))

# The logistic regression model was applied to new customer data to predict churn probabilities. 
# These probabilities were then classified into binary outcomes(the logic are same us the above one), 
# the model suggests a predicted churn rate of approximately 11.7% for the new customers.


# Generate the barplot show Predicted Exited Proportion by Geography and Gender, and by Num Of Products
# Create a data frame for plotting
plot_data <- data.frame(
  Status = c("Not Churned", "Churned"),

# We can see that the count of consumers anticipated to churn (coral section) is often fewer than those predicted to stay (red segment). 
# In contrast to France and Spain, there is a discernible difference in Germany, where the coral segment is significantly larger and implies a higher churn prediction for both genders.
# The percentage of consumers expected to stay is higher than the percentage expected to exit in each of the three countries.
# Within the same nation, there doesn't seem to be much of a gender variation in the percentage of expected churn.
# For both genders, Germany exhibits a greater predicted exited rate than France and Spain.
# Here are some suggestions:
# 1.	Concentrated Efforts in Germany: Because of the higher anticipated churn rates, give Germany top priority for retention efforts. 
# Adopt specialized tactics, reward schemes, and merchandise that meets the needs of German consumers.
# 2.	New Strategies: Make better use of product offers, communication, and support tactics to improve customer retention.
# Also can set up the strategies by different gender, for example: Woman's products(credit cards) or promotions.
# 3.	Feedback and Incentives: Establish a methodical procedure for gathering customer feedback, 
# and create incentive plans that use exclusive deals and discounts to entice high-risk clients(for example: only have one product clients) who are about to leave.
