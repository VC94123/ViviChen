1. Project Overview: Sustainable Wedding Vendors Analysis Project
This project investigates whether wedding vendors with sustainable practices are more cost-effective. Through a structured analysis combining SQL and Python, it aims to provide clear insights into sustainable practices in the wedding industry.
Analysis Framework: Sets the stage by defining 'sustainable practices' and 'cost-effective' with credible sources, addressing the market's need for sustainability.
SQL and Dataset Preparation: Employs SQL for data exploration and preparation, setting up a robust dataset for in-depth Python analysis.
Python Data Science: Utilizes Python for statistical analysis and data visualization, such as scatterplots and boxplots, to uncover patterns and insights.
Actionable Insights: Offers practical, actionable insights backed by credible sources to enhance sustainability and cost-effectiveness for wedding vendors.
Documentation: Delivers findings through professional documentation in a Jupyter Notebook and HTML page, alongside SQL scripts, making the analysis accessible to a wide audience.

2. Project Overview: Group Assignment- Wedding Cost Breakdown Analysis
This project showcases our group project on analyzing wedding expenses, where I focused on data exploration and analysis.
My role involved utilizing SQL for data extraction and preparation(create temporary table and use UNION to collect all temporary table), followed by employing Python with libraries such as NumPy for detailed statistical analysis(calculate the departments cost percentage). 
This approach enabled us to delve deep into the cost patterns associated with weddings, aiming to offer actionable insights for cost-effective wedding planning. 
The use of NumPy was crucial for handling complex numerical data, allowing us to efficiently compute descriptive statistics and analyze trends.

3. Project Overview: H_Market Analysis
This is my individual SQL project focused on the H_Market database.
My task was to create challenging SQL queries covering advanced topics like GROUP BY/HAVING, Subqueries, CASE, INNER JOIN, and LEFT/RIGHT JOIN.
Each question is designed to probe the database deeply, testing not only my SQL skills but also providing a rich learning resource for future students.
By tackling these queries, I aimed to enhance my understanding of SQL while contributing to the next group of learners.
This project reflects my initiative to go beyond the basics, showcasing my ability to handle complex SQL tasks and analyze real-world data scenarios.

4. Project Overview: Bank Churn Prediction Project Using Logistic Regression
This project employs logistic regression to predict customer churn for a bank.
After handling missing values, I divide the BankChurnDataset into training and testing sets to train our model.
And evaluate its performance based on accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity.
Finally, the logistic regression model is utilized to forecast churn among new customers using the NewCustomerDataset.
This project details my methodology, from data preprocessing to the application of logistic regression for predictive analysis.

5. Project Overview: World Bank Data Analysis- Life Expectancy vs. Fertility Rate
This project examines the relationship between Life Expectancy and Fertility Rate across various world regions for the years 1960 and 2020.
Utilizing R for data processing and scatterplot visualizations, the analysis seeks to identify trends and changes in these demographic indicators over the sixty-year span.
The visual comparisons between the two periods aim to shed light on global demographic trends and their implications for health and development strategies.
